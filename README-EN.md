## What's New in v4.3 — Precedent Citator + Point-in-Time Law

### `cite_check` — "Is this precedent still good law?" (Korean Shepard's)

Give it a case number (e.g. `2007다27670`). It back-traces every later decision citing that case via full-text search, deep-scans en banc decisions for overruling language ("…변경하기로 한다"), and tracks alias references like "(이하 '2008년 전원합의체 판결'이라 한다)". Verdict: ✅ still cited / ⚠️ en banc successor exists / ❌ overruling detected — with the exact holding context.

### `applicable_law` — "Which version of the law applies to my case date?"

Give it a statute + a date. It pins the version in force on that date (MST), fetches the article as it read then, diffs against the current text, and extracts transitional provisions (적용례·경과조치) from every later amendment's addenda — plus lex temporis guidance (Criminal Act §1, General Act on Public Administration §14).

---

## v3.5 — Citation Hallucination Guard

**Catches fake article citations in AI-generated legal answers in real time.** Cross-verifies every citation against Korea's official law database.

```
"Under Civil Act Article 750, damages may be claimed for tort;
 Labor Standards Act Article 60 Paragraph 1 provides annual leave;
 Commercial Act Article 401-2 Paragraph 7 imposes director liability;
 Criminal Act Article 9999 imposes aggravated punishment."
```

→ Run `verify_citations` (actual verification result against 법제처 API):

- ✓ Civil Act Article 750 (Tort liability) — exists
- ✓ Labor Standards Act Article 60 (Annual paid leave) Paragraph 1 — exists
- ✗ **Commercial Act Article 401-2 — Paragraph 7 doesn't exist (max Paragraph 2)**
- ✗ **Criminal Act Article 9999 — no such article (valid range: Art.1~Art.372)**

**Don't blindly trust ChatGPT/Claude legal answers.** Essential reliability check for legal AI services, law firms, students, contract review.

## What's New in v3.2.0+ — Smart Scenarios

**Same 14 tools, 7 new analysis scenarios.** Just ask in natural language — the AI detects what you need and runs extra analysis automatically.

| Ask this | Get this |
|----------|---------|
| "Food Sanitation Act penalty reduction possible?" | Penalty schedule + violation clauses + appeal cases where penalties were reduced |
| "Import customs FTA check" | Customs Act + customs interpretations + FTA treaties + tariff tables + tax tribunal rulings |
| "Building Act permit procedure" | Legal basis (Act→Decree→Rule) + fees/forms + admin rules + local ordinance exceptions |
| "National Health Insurance Act delegation" | Finds delegated provisions where implementing decrees haven't been created yet |
| "Building Act impact analysis" | Subordinate laws + nationwide ordinances affected + related admin rules |
| "Labor Standards Act amendment timeline" | Old/new comparison + article history + precedents/interpretations mapped chronologically |
| "Parking ordinance compliance check" | Constitutional Court decisions + admin appeal cancellations + parent law basis |

> **No changes to how you use it.** Ask naturally, get deeper analysis automatically.

<summary>v3.3.0~v3.3.1 changes</summary>

**v3.3.1** — Law alias dictionary expansion (11 → 52 entries, +41)

Triggered by a lexdiff hallucination case where "산안기준규칙" (산업안전보건기준에 관한 규칙) got keyword-matched to "국가표준기본법" by Korea Law Open API's aiSearch. Expanded `LAW_ALIAS_ENTRIES` in `lib/search-normalizer.ts` with high-frequency abbreviations across labor/safety (산안법, 중처법, 근기법), privacy/telecom (개보법, 정보통신망법), anti-corruption (청탁금지법, 이해충돌방지법), public contracting (국가계약법, 지방계약법), real estate (주임법, 상임법, 부거법), antitrust (공정거래법, 하도급법, 약관법, 표시광고법, 가맹사업법), finance (자본시장법, 특금법, 전금법), urban planning (국토계획법, 도정법), environment/health (감염병예방법, 대기환경법), transport (여객운수법, 화물운수법), procedure (민소법, 형소법, 민집법), social insurance (국건법, 산재보험법, 고보법), and telecom (전기통신사업법). Since `api-client.ts` and `law-parser.ts` already consume `resolveLawAlias()`, the existing search pipeline gets the benefit automatically. 45/45 tests passing (41 new + 4 regression).

**v3.3.0** — HTTP stateless mode + kordoc 2.3.0

Root-cause fix for the remote server (`korean-law-mcp.fly.dev`) periodically losing sessions due to OOM-driven restarts. Switched to MCP's official stateless pattern (`sessionIdGenerator: undefined`): fresh `Server + Transport` per request, released on response close. Removed in-memory session Map, `InMemoryEventStore`, and idle cleanup — eliminating leak sources entirely. Survives restarts, scale-out, and rolling deploys with zero client disruption. `GET /mcp` and `DELETE /mcp` return `405` (matching the SDK example). API keys are isolated per-request via `AsyncLocalStorage`.

- **HTTP stateless transition** — [src/server/http-server.ts](src/server/http-server.ts) (ref: `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/examples/server/simpleStatelessStreamableHttp.js`)
- **kordoc 2.2.5 → 2.3.0**
- **Session management code removed** — `sessions` Map, `MAX_SESSIONS`, 10-min idle `setInterval`, `InMemoryEventStore`, POST/GET/DELETE branching (~50 LOC net reduction)

**v3.2.2** — `get_annexes` direct exposure. Auto-fetch annexes on refund/fee keywords.

**v3.2.1** — kordoc 2.2.5 update.

</details>

<summary>v3.1.0~v3.1.5 changes</summary>

**v3.1.5** — kordoc 2.2.4 + README modernization.

**v3.1.4** — kordoc 2.2.4 update. HTML `<table>` for merged cells, markdownToHwpx improvements.

**v3.1.3** — Empty search result hints for 18 tools. Session cleanup interval reduced.

## Why this exists

South Korea has **1,600+ active laws**, **10,000+ administrative rules**, and a precedent system spanning Supreme Court, Constitutional Court, tax tribunals, and customs rulings. All of this lives behind a clunky government API with zero developer experience.

This project wraps that entire legal system into **14 structured tools** that any AI assistant or script can call. Built by a Korean civil servant who got tired of manually searching [법제처](https://www.law.go.kr) for the hundredth time.

---

## Quick Start

### Option 1: MCP Server (Claude Desktop / Cursor / Windsurf)

**Auto setup (recommended):**

```bash
npx korean-law-mcp setup
```

Interactive wizard handles API key input, client selection, and config file registration.
Supports Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code, Windsurf, and Gemini CLI.

**Manual setup:**

```bash
npm install -g korean-law-mcp
```

Add to your MCP client config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "korean-law": {
      "command": "korean-law-mcp",
      "env": {
        "LAW_OC": "your-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Get your free API key at [법제처 Open API](https://open.law.go.kr/LSO/openApi/guideResult.do).

| Client | Config File |
|--------|------------|
| Claude Desktop | `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` (Win) / `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (Mac) |
| Cursor | `.cursor/mcp.json` |
| Windsurf | `.windsurf/mcp.json` |
| Continue | `~/.continue/config.json` |
| Zed | `~/.config/zed/settings.json` |

### Option 2: Remote (No Install)

**Claude Desktop** does not support remote HTTP MCP servers directly. Use the `mcp-remote` adapter (requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 18+ for `npx`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "korean-law": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://korean-law-mcp.fly.dev/mcp?oc=your-api-key"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Cursor, Windsurf, and other clients with native remote HTTP support** — use the URL directly:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "korean-law": {
      "url": "https://korean-law-mcp.fly.dev/mcp?oc=your-api-key"
    }
  }
}
```

**For web clients (Claude.ai, etc.)** — same URL works everywhere. v3 exposes only 14 tools by default, no profile selection needed.

> 14 tools (8 chains + 2 core + 2 unified + 2 meta) cover all 41 APIs. Use `discover_tools` → `execute_tool` for specialized tools.

**API Key Delivery** (priority order):

| Method | Example | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| URL query | `?oc=your-key` | Simplest for web clients. Auto-applies to entire session |
| HTTP header | `apikey: your-key` | Also supports `law-oc`, `x-api-key`, `Authorization: Bearer` |
| Tool parameter | `apiKey: "your-key"` | Per-tool override |

### Option 3: CLI

```bash
npm install -g korean-law-mcp
export LAW_OC=your-api-key

korean-law search_law --query "관세법"
korean-law get_law_text --mst 160001 --jo "제38조"
korean-law search_precedents --query "부당해고"
korean-law list                          # all tools
korean-law list --category 판례          # filter by category
korean-law help search_law               # tool help
```

### Option 4: Docker

```bash
docker build -t korean-law-mcp .
docker run -e LAW_OC=your-api-key -p 3000:3000 korean-law-mcp
```
